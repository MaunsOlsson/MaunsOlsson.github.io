                    <h2>Welcome to my page</h2>
							</p> My name is Pontus Olsson. I'm a recent graduate of Bachelor of Science majoring in Statistics
                            at Link√∂ping University. As a Statistics major, I have previously worked with analysis in R and SAS with methods such as datamining, multivariate analysis and baysian statistics. Under my studies I have also worked in data gathering at
                            Origo Group. During my regular practices in improving my skills, I realised that I need a place to both reflect and publish my works, hence I created my own website.</p>
							</p> I'm the sole author of the paper <i>Becoming deposited and refunded - A transfer function model for estimation of average usage time on beverage containers</i>, a paper
                            I wrote for and in collaboration with Returpack AB. The paper in short describes how a transfer function model - a time series method that measures how two variables correlation transfers through time -
                            could be used to assume average usage of a beverage container. This paper is sadly not yet acessable to the public since a desicion has not been made, since the confidentiallity of the subject.
